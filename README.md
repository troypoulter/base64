## Why build this?

I found the current online tools to encode and decode Base64 text either didn't update as you typed, required page refreshes or even send a request to an API to process it. I thought there should be a simpler way that adhered to three main requirements:

- **Real-time updates**: No more clicking buttons repeatedly. I wanted a tool that instantly reflected any changes I made.
- **Simultaneous updates**: The ability to modify either the encoded or decoded text and see the other update automatically, even if it meant amusing symbols when altering the encoded text.
- **Utmost privacy**: Above all, I sought a solution that assured me my data would not be sent or stored beyond the confines of my own browser. And with the code open-source here, hopefully that provides even more confidence!
